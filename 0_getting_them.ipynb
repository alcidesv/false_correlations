      "One of the promises of big data is accurate predictions. That is, if we start with a huge number of  cases and a lot of information about each case, we should be able to find patterns in the data and use those patterns to say how new cases will resolve. For example, we can use information about a customer and her purchase history to predict which item from a shop inventory she is more likely to purchase. Then we can suggest the predicted items to the customer, and since the item is relevant to her, she is more likely to buy it. The net result should be increased sales. But there is a problem: false correlations. In a short sentence, they are accidents that happen when we have a lot of data... which is a bummer when talking about Big Data. Tyler Vigen, a student of law at Harvard, has some amusing examples in [his website](http://www.tylervigen.com/). For businesses relying on complex analytics, false correlations are a sort of mathematical mirage that can rush their analysts and systems to incorrect conclusions. So much that Prof. Michael I. Jordan go as far as to coin the term \"big data winter\"[^b]. But when are we exactly at risk of having false correlations? \n",

      "The table symbolizes two facts across seven observations: to buy shoes of a given size, and to buy or not to buy a goblin hat. Do they fullfil our previous definition of correlation? By having a look at the table, we notice that customers that bought a goblin hat had very small feet! We can be more formal with the help of a so called _correlation measure_. A correlation measure take two magnitudes \u2013 like the ones represented in the two columns of the table \u2013 and returns a number. There are dozens of correlation measures, so I will just pick one which is common and also works nicely with our definitions and examples, the [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)(SR). If we denote the cases where the customer bought a hat with the number \"1\", and the cases where the customer didn't buy a hat with the number \"0\", we get a SR of -0.8736 for the table above[^d]. \n",

      "Yep, no values of correlation that may indicate somethin real behind. The table contains the items together with their  SR value against the last column, and the respective p-value. Those p-values are high enough that we can't mistake the SR value for a true correlation.... so far we have been lucky. Now, what happens when we pick more items  _simultaneously_ and try to automatically construct rules about how they affect the shoe size? Well, if you look for them, you will find them. For example, people who pick one and just one of \"Snickers\" or \"100 calory pack\" seem to have small feet, and if we were to compute the p-value just as before, we would find it low enough. Constructions like \"X and Y\",  \"X or not Y\", etc, receive the name of boolean functions. For this particular case, there are around 130 ways of picking combinations of columns and boolean functions. They are evenly spread on 128 ways of giving a row a zero or a one. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can put these numbers into formulas. I have been using boolean functions on $k$ columns. The number of those functions for a given $k$ is $2^{2^k}$. So with $k=2$ we have 16 functions which are [relatively well known](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BooleanFunction.html). With $k=3$, we have 256 functions. If the total number of columns is $Y$, then we can pick $\\binom{Y}{k}$ combinations of columns. If we put together the boolean functions and  the rules, we obtain $2^{2^k} \\binom{Y}{k}$ different things to try. Those rules may match a significant number of the $2^r$ ways of assigning zeros and ones to the $r$ rows in the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, this is it: now we know one possible way of estimating the chance of hitting false correlations. Caveat emptor, this describes only the basic case  where most of the variables can simply take 0 or 1 as values. Other cases may be different. "
